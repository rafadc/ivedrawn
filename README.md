I've drawn...
=============

A simple picture guessing game written using node.js

# Rules

The rules of the game are simple. The game will randomly select one of the
players that is connected to the web and let him draw in a canvas. The rest
of the players connected to the web must find out what he is trying to
draw typing in a little text box under the canvas. The player that is drawing
selects one of the answers as correct and the player that got it right is the
next player drawing.

In order to avoid the game to be too long there is a 4 minute timer that
makes a random player to draw.

# Demo

I've installed [a little demo](http://vks11798.ip-37-59-119.eu/) at a VPS.

I cannot guarantee that is up and running ;)
